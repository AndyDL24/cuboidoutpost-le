# Cuboid Outpost (Luxury Edition) ModPack

[Cuboid Outpost](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cuboid-outpost) was my first attempt at creating a ModPack for Minecraft. It's been amazingly well received - way beyond my hopes and expectations. This version of the pack is for players / communities with higher-spec machines to play on. 

The original pack was made with a view to making it accessible to as many people as possible, and therefore was aimed at being fairly light, and I've resisted adding more mods so as to still let people with Potato PC's play. I want to stick to that as much as possible for the original pack, but due to the number of people asking (repeatedly) for a few extra building blocks to choose from and some quality of life mods too, I've decided to release the same pack with some nice-to-have mods included. That's this pack!

The quest and storyline remains unchanged compared to Cuboid Outpost, as does the progression - but there are now a few more things available to build with, a few more gadgets available to make, and some quality of life additions. If you haven't got a Potato PC, and enjoy having a bigger palette of blocks to build from, then you might want to try this version of the pack. If you try this version and your PC is struggling, I suggest you try playing the original Cuboid Outpost instead, which has approximately 30 fewer mods in it overall.

The basic premise is this... you're stranded on a barren planet, civilization as you knew it has come to an abrupt end, and need to recreate life as you knew it. There are a few twists and turns along the way of course!

I designed this to be more of an intermediate tech pack for those just getting into Modded Minecraft, or who are looking for something not too hard / expert. As a result, while there are quite a few mods in the pack, I've intentionally kept the number of alternatives for things low (e.g. for digital storage there's only AE2 initially, but channels are disabled to make it easier to work with - RS is available later on).

Some great content mods have been added too to keep things interesting and a bit different. And then there are a few unique mods that you won't have seen in any other pack before too - so hopefully there's something for everyone.

I've spent a lot of time working on Quests (possibly the hardest thing to get right in creating a ModPack!), as well as on the storyline, so hopefully it will be enjoyable for you.

I would really appreciate any issues you encounter while playing being reported in the Issues for the Cuboid Outpost (Luxury Edition) ModPack in GitHub - I do only work on this in my (very limited) spare time, so I can't promise I'll resolve things immediately, but I do plan on trying to get around to fixing issues when I can. I would also appreciate a little bit of patience, and a civil tone when reporting issues - this is just something I'm doing for fun, for free, and in my own time, so if you could avoid sucking the life out of this experience for me by being rude or overly critical, I'd really appreciate that too!
