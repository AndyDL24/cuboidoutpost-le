## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost (Luxury Edition) 1.0.10

This is the first release of Cuboid Outpost (Luxury Edition)!

It's essentially the same as the Cuboid Outpost mod pack, but has a bunch of extra mods in it providing additional building blocks, a few tools and add-ons, and quality of life mods included by default. 

With nearly 30 extra mods in it, it may not be suitable for everyone though, so if you try this and your PC isn't coping, you might want to try the original Cuboid Outpost modpack instead. Both packs will be kept in sync as far as the main storyline, quests and progression go, so apart from the extra "nice to have" mods, you won't be missing out.

p.s. It *should* be possible to copy a save from the same version of the original Cuboid Outpost pack into a fresh install of Cuboid Outpost (Luxury Edition) and retain your progress, but there are no guarantees. All I can say is that it worked for me!
