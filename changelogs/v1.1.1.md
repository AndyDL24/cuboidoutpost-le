## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost (Luxury Edition) 1.1.1

### Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- A few more quest typos sorted out.
- Added a tweak to mean that a dragon egg will appear for each end dragon killed.
- Removed TOP Addons - players were sometimes experiencing "freezes" when looking at Mekanism pipes on servers. Hopefully this will stop this happening, though some additional information that TOP Addons was showing will no longer be available.
